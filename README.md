## About The Project

**Modramon** is an ambitious open-source project to build a powerful, feature-rich, and highly customizable Discord bot as a superior alternative to pay-walled bots like MEE6. Our mission is to provide every server admin with the essential tools they need for moderation, engagement, and management, completely free of charge.

This organization hosts the two core components of the Modramon ecosystem: the web backend and the bot client.

## Our Core Repositories

| Repository | Description | Tech Stack |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
|  durgarian/modramon-laravel | **The Web Dashboard & API.** The brain of the operation, where users will manage their server settings, view stats, and configure every aspect of the bot. | `Laravel` `Inertia.js` `Vue.js` `TailwindCSS` `MySQL`|
| durgarian/modramon-node | **The Discord Bot Client.** The heart of the project, this is the Node.js application that connects to the Discord Gateway, listens for commands, and executes actions. | `Node.js` `Discord.js` `TypeScript` |

## üöÄ Our Tech Stack

We use a modern and robust tech stack to ensure Modramon is both powerful and maintainable:

* **Backend (Dashboard & API):** [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) - For a powerful, secure, and scalable foundation.
* **Frontend (Dashboard UI):** [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) with [Inertia.js](https://inertiajs.com/) & [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For a seamless and beautiful single-page application experience.
* **Bot Client (Discord Gateway):** [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) with [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org/) - For high-performance, real-time interaction with the Discord API.

## ü§ù Get Involved!

We believe in the power of community and open-source collaboration. Whether you're a developer, a designer, or just a passionate Discord user, there are many ways to contribute!

1.  **Check out the `roadmap.md`** in our core repositories to see what's planned.
2.  **Fork a repository** and submit a pull request for a new feature or bug fix.
3.  **Open an issue** to report bugs or suggest new ideas.
4.  **Join our community Discord server** (link coming soon!) to chat with the developers and other contributors.

Every contribution, no matter how small, helps us build a better bot for everyone.
